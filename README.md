# Quantifying Urban Heat Challenges and Green Infrastructure Solutions in Paris

This repository contains the code, datasets, and analysis for a study on **climate and social inequalities in Paris**.  
It quantifies the **Urban Heat Island (UHI)** effect, analyzes **socioeconomic vulnerability**, and evaluates **adaptation strategies** through real data.

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to:
- Quantify **long-term temperature trends** in Paris (1873–2024).  
- Measure and visualize the **Urban Heat Island (UHI)** effect using local temperature and land-use indicators.
- Analyze **future climate projections** for the Paris region to assess potential changes in heat intensity.  
- Examine how **income levels, population density, and green space availability** influence exposure to urban heat.  
- Provide an initial **cost-benefit analysis** of adaptation measures implemented by the City of Paris.

## Why It Matters
Extreme heat is one of the fastest-growing urban risks in Europe.  
This project shows how **environmental and social data** can be combined to guide **equitable climate adaptation policies**.
